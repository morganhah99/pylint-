	<h1>How to use Pylint</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>If you are new to coding standards, Pylint can guide you to see what's really going on in the background and help you become a more aware programmer.<br>
Learning how to share code with others is imperative in the programming field.<br>
It would be almost impossible to work on code with multiple people if they all used their own style of writing it.<br>
Which is why the Python community has formalized some recommended programming styles to help everyone write<br>
code in a uniformed way that makes the most sense for shared code.
This style is captured in PEP-8, Pylint can be a quick and easy way of seeing if your code has captured the essence<br> 
of PEP-8 and is therefore 'friendly' to other potential users.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Running Pylint with no arguments will invoke the help dialogue and give you an idea of the arguments available to you.<br>
This gives you a hint of what Pylint is going to pick up on:</p>

<h2>First Pylint'ing</h2>
<p>We'll use the Multiplication class as an example:</p>

<div>

</div>
<p>If we run this we get the following:</p>
<div>
	<img src="output.png">
</div>
<br>
<p>If I didn't know what the first error message meant, I could run this command as an example:</p>
<div id="small">
	<img src="msg.png">
</div>
<p>You can repeat this process until you fix all error messages</p>
